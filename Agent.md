I want not so polished UI , UI as average coder.
Every time you , create routes give me a api tester file so that I check api later , write all api testing int that file 
also Give me file reviews in a file so that I can see the modification each time , write all modification in that file
Also give a file where I can learn how you implement the backend code for each feature , in a file write this every time
Besides, dont remove existing file.
Also dont use any other library without which we used already



CSE216 Project Checklists


Note: The examples mentioned in the checklist refer to a sample/dummy project called a 'Research Network Social Platform' and are provided only to illustrate appropriate use cases.
Dummy project: Research Network Social Platform (similar to academic collaboration networks such as ResearchGate). The system may allow researchers to create profiles, upload publications, follow other researchers, join research groups, and track citations.



1.	User Authentication

Ensure that authentication of users is handled by your own code (not through any third party service). You may use session_id or JWT for handling user authentication.



2.	Authentication Validation on Every Page

You must check authentication on every page to ensure that a user is authenticated before processing any HTTP request.



3.	Explicit Transaction Control

Ensure that you implement explicit transaction control in every DML operation in the database.

Explicit transaction control means you must use COMMIT and ROLLBACK if your server executes a transaction involving insert, update, or delete operations.
Example: When uploading a publication, the system inserts the paper, inserts authors, and updates researcher statistics. If any step fails, the transaction should be rolled back.



4.	Use of Triggers

Ensure that you use one or more triggers.

Triggers can be used for data validation before DML operations or for logging sensitive actions to a shadow table.
 
Example: A trigger may automatically update the citation count of a publication when a new citation record is inserted.



5.	Use of Functions

Ensure that you use one or more functions.

Functions should be used when a statistical or computed value must be returned from the database.
Example: A function may return the h-index of a researcher calculated from their publications and citation counts.



6.	Use of Procedures

Ensure that you use at least one procedure.

Procedures should be used when a multi-step workflow modifies several tables in one operation.
Example: A procedure may handle uploading a publication, which inserts the paper, records multiple authors, and updates publication statistics in one transaction.



7.	Use of Complex Queries

Ensure that your project uses three or more complex queries.

A complex query is defined as one that retrieves data from multiple tables and/or uses aggregation functions.
Example: A query that lists top researchers in a research field based on total citations across all their publications.
You may implement statistical or analytics pages (such as 'Top Researchers', 'Most Cited Papers', or 'Active Research Groups') to demonstrate these complex queries.
 
8.	Appropriate Use of Database Features

Ensure that database features are used only where appropriate. Avoid implementing unnecessary triggers, procedures, or functions. Correct identification of appropriate use cases is an important part of the evaluation.



9.	You must be capable to understand your own code

Ensure that you understand each and every part of your code. During evaluation, you may be asked to explain a part of you
